## Task:

Create a blog or blog-like application written in PHP and MySQL that works as a smaller CMS where you can add, edit and delete content. 
You should also be able to vote or like the content of your application and log in and log out with different users who have different roles.

## Functionality:

If you are visiting the blog you can read all blogposts, leave comments and like or dislike the posts. As a logged in user you can create blogposts, you can also edit your own blogposts and delete it right after you created it. If you are logged in as Admin you will be able to edit and delete all blogposts anytime. 

## Languages and techniques:

- PHP
- MySQL
- MAMP
- Ajax fetch - Vanilla JavaScript 
- Bootstrap for styling
